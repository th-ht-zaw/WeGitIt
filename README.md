# Tea Weightloss Plan Calculator
This will calculate low long you should drink tea if you are aiming for weightloss.
It will need some information about your current health and body mass such as height, weight and BMI.
Note that only drinking tea will not help you with weightloss. Tea can be used as a supplement to a healthy diet and lifestyle.

# Instructions
Follow the prompts given in the terminal.
First an introduction to our program should appear as well as a prompt to input a symptom or flavor. Once you input a selection, the database will list a few teas you can pick from or you can continue to choose symptoms and/or flavors. Once you have a particular tea you are interested in, type the name at the prompt and a detailed description of the tea should appear. After that you may exit the program or return to the beginning in search for another tea from another unique combination of symptoms and flavors.
