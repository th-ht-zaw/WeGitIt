#Tea Database:

A database to help you choose a tea best suited for you.
This will be based on symptoms you have. Examples of symptoms would be stress, difficulty sleeping and headaches. Alternatively, you may choose flavors you like or you can choose from both symptoms and flavors.

#Instructions:

Follow the prompts given in the terminal.
First an introduction to our program should appear as well as a prompt to input a symptom or flavor. Once you input a selection, the database will list a few teas you can pick from or you can continue to choose symptoms and/or flavors. Once you have a particular tea you are interested in, type the name at the prompt and a detailed description of the tea should appear. After that you may exit the program or return to the beginning in search for another tea.
